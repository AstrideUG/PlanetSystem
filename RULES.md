Project-Rules:
Version and branches:
- We fallow the sematic version principle -> https://semver.org/
- Each version has an own branch, when the version is stable and completed then it gets merged into the master.
- Each new feature should be on an own branch and gets then merged with a pull-request into the destination branch
  of the version where the developer is working on.
